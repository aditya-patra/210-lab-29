Project Overview:
Project simulates a county consisting of farms. 
The project simulates how various farmers fight over the same piece of land(as land is limited in a county), predicting how the number of livestock of each farmer changes(the amount of land a farmer has is based on his lifestock, as land is just used for grazing). 
By predicting the change in livestock of each farmer, the program demonstrates how the success of various individuals depends on supply and demand as well as natural crises.
The project will simulate changes in the livestock of each farmer over 300 years, reevaluating the livestock of each farmer every 5 years.

Implementation:
The key will be a farmer name and the array will be the livestock, with each list corresponding to a different animal.
std::map will store farmer data with each farmer and his livestock as a key-value pair.
The key in each pair will store the farmer name while the value will store an std::array containing
