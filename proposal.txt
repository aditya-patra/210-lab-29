Project Overview:
Project simulates a county consisting of farms. 
The project simulates how various farmers fight over the same piece of land(as land is limited in a county), predicting how the number of livestock and land taken by each farmer changes. 
By predicting the change in livestock of each farmer, the program demonstrates how the success of various individuals depends on supply and demand as well as natural crises.
The project will simulate changes in the livestock and land of each farmer over 300 years, reevaluating the livestock of each farmer every 5 years.

Implementation:
The key will be a farmer name and the array will be the livestock, with each list corresponding to a different animal.
std::map will store farmer data with each farmer and his livestock as a key-value pair.
The key in each pair will store the farmer name while the value will store an std::array containing 3 lists, one for the livestock, one for the land taken by each type of livestock, and one for the value of each type of livestock.
Each simulation of changes in a farmer's belongings only directly changes livestock, but the amount of livestock determines land and value of the farmer.

Simulated Events:
Land is split into segments, with each segment being able to support a specific number of each type of livestock.
Each segment can only support one type of livestock - can be attributed to each type of livestock requiring specific farm equipment and buildings
Simulation focuses on changes in livestock first.
For each farmer, change in livestock is calculated.
Livestock count can change through the following processes:
 - propogation: population increase is based on livestock cap and rate of growth varies by species
 - natural death: chance of death varies between livestock species
 - sudden illness: all livestock have equal chance of becoming ill
 - plague: 80% of that type of livestock die for that farmer
After livestock change, program determines changes in land. If there is available land, there is an 80% chance of it being randomly split between existing farmers and a 20% chance of a new farmer taking it.
 - If a new farmer takes it, type of livestock is randomly decided and starts at halfway to the population cap
 - If land is given to an existing farmer, there is an equal chance of it going to any livestock species or going to a new species
Value of each livestock for each farmer is then calculated.
