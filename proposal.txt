Project Overview:
Project simulates a county consisting of farms. 
The project simulates how various farmers fight over the same piece of land(as land is limited in a county), predicting how the number of livestock and land taken by each farmer changes. 
By predicting the change in livestock of each farmer, the program demonstrates how the success of various individuals depends on supply and demand as well as natural crises.
The project will simulate changes in the livestock and land of each farmer over 300 years, reevaluating the livestock of each farmer every 5 years.

Implementation:
The key will be a farmer name and the array will be the livestock, with each list corresponding to a different animal.
std::map will store farmer data with each farmer and his livestock as a key-value pair.
The key in each pair will store the farmer name while the value will store an std::array containing 3 lists, one for the livestock, one for the land taken by each type of livestock, and one for the value of each type of livestock.
Each simulation of changes in a farmer's belongings only directly changes livestock, but the amount of livestock determines land and value of the farmer.

Simulated Events:
Simulation focuses on changes in livestock first.
Each type of livestock for a farmer has a cap based on the number of land segments allocated.
Livestock count can change through the following processes.
