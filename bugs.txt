Bug 1: plot allocation to random farmer once plot opens up is hardcoded to assuming there are 100 farmers to choose from.
    Fix: use map.size() and iterate through the map to find the correct key value to update the corresponding animal field size
Bug 2: addition of new animal is limited to 4 of the 5 possible animals
    Fix: increase rand() and add cow as possible animal (also make rand return int)
Bug 3: new index is created for each animal added during plot allocation
    Fix: if index exists, add to that index instead of creating new one
Bug 4: indices that farmers have lost are not being removed from the list
    Fix: removed empty indices from farmers
Bug 5: animal populations seem to be uncapped(max_pop is most likely not being used)
    Fix: make sure that animal population doesn't exceed cap
Bug 6: chance of natural death is equal for all animals(chances of each death occuring is the same, but there should be variance in that as well)
    Fix: make it based on animal value so animals like horses live longer than chickens(also create new rand constants for each possibility)
Bug 7: effect of plague is constant, should be variable
    Fix: make plague decrease population by anywhere between 80% and 90%.
Bug 8: farmers with no animals/land are still part of the list
    Fix: remove farmers with no animals
Bug 9: When checking whether an animal dies, curr_pop is reduced while the iterator keeps increasing, meaning not every animal is checked for death
    Fix: decrease e when an animal dies
